A shared repo
## First Segment Write-Up
The topic we selected for our project is heart disease. We selected this topic because the final product will be something that can potentially help people. The dataset we are using was found on Kaggle and provides predictive factors of heart disease. Our goal is to analyze our dataset that contains a variety of factors in patients such as age, cholesterol, max heart rate and others. From these factors, we will build a machine learning model that looks to predict heart disease in patients. We identified that binary classifiers were best because we are predicting a discrete outcome: whether a user has heart disease or doesn’t. We plan to test different models such as logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks. In addition, we will build a webpage that will allow users to input information and receive feedback regarding their heart health.
